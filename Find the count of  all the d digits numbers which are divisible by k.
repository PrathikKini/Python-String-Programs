 4. Find the count of  all the d digits numbers which are divisible by k
Example: 
d = 2 , k = 9 
All 2 digit numbers range from 10 to 99. 
Between 10 and 99, there are total 10 numbers present which are divisible by 9. 
Your function should return 10. 

import math
n, number = 2, 9

first_number = math.pow(10,n-1)
second_number = math.pow(10,n)

cnt = 0
for i in range(int(first_number),int(second_number)):
    if (i%number==0):
        cnt += 1
print(cnt)
